ReactJS developer interview test:

Write a program that will play this game against the computer.
The game should end once there is a winner. If the game is a tie then the program must make the user play again, until there is a winner. 

Once there is a winner, the program (game) must end. 
When the program begins, a random number is created between 1 and 5.

These values will be used as follows:

   1. Rock
   
   2. Paper
   
   3. Scissors
   
   4. Lizard
   
   5. Spock
   
   
Use a menu to prompt the user for their choice, using the same values as above. 
The program should then display the computerâ€™s choice and indicate who has won.

A winner is selected using the following rules:

   - Scissors cut paper
   
   - Paper covers rock
   
   - Rock crushes lizard
   
   - Lizard poisons Spock
   
   - Spock smashes (or melts) scissors
   
   - Scissors decapitate lizard
   
   - Lizard eats paper
   
   - Paper disproves Spock
   
   - Spock vaporizes rock
   
   - Rock breaks scissors
